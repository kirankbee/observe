there are several open source packages that are recommended for model deployment. Here are a few examples:

TensorFlow Serving: This is an open source serving system for machine learning models that is developed by Google. It provides a flexible architecture for deploying models, supports a wide range of model types and platforms, and provides robust monitoring and scaling capabilities.

PyTorch Serve: This is an open source model serving tool that is developed by Facebook. It provides a high-performance and scalable serving infrastructure for PyTorch models, and supports features such as model versioning, multi-model serving, and dynamic batching.

Seldon Core: This is an open source platform for deploying and managing machine learning models at scale. It provides a range of features such as model versioning, A/B testing, and model explainability, and supports multiple machine learning frameworks including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and XGBoost.

MLflow: This is an open source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, including model deployment. It provides a simple REST API for deploying models, supports multiple deployment targets including Docker and Kubernetes, and integrates with popular machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.

Cortex: This is an open source platform for deploying machine learning models in production. It provides a simple API for deploying models, supports multiple machine learning frameworks, and provides features such as auto-scaling, load balancing, and model monitoring.

These open source packages provide a range of capabilities for model deployment and management, and the specific choice will depend on your requirements and the machine learning framework that you are using.



BENTOML
BentoML is another great open source package for deploying machine learning models. It provides a simple and flexible framework for packaging, deploying, and managing models in production. Here are some benefits of BentoML:

Simplified deployment: BentoML provides a simple API for deploying models to various target platforms such as Kubernetes, Docker, and serverless environments.

Model serving: BentoML allows users to serve their models through various means such as REST API, batch processing, and real-time stream processing.

Model packaging: With BentoML, models can be packaged with all their dependencies and configuration files for easy deployment.

Scalability: BentoML enables easy scaling of models to handle high traffic and larger workloads.

Customizability: BentoML provides flexibility in defining custom model serving and deployment configurations.

Overall, BentoML is a great choice for deploying machine learning models, especially for developers who want a flexible and lightweight framework for serving their models. BentoML supports a wide range of machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn, and provides features such as model versioning, monitoring, and management.
